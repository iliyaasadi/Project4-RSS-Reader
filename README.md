A brief description of what this project does and who it's for: This project is $\color{green}{\textit{RSS Reader}}$ in Java language.In this project, There are some URL of websites in the data.txt file; when the program starts, there are 4 choices:showing the updates, adding URL , removing URL and exit the application.
